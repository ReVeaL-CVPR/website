abstract = "Mobile applications (a.k.a., apps), which facilitate a large variety of tasks, have become indispensable in our everyday lives. Many tasks require the user to navigate between multiple apps. Unlike Web pages that are inherently interconnected through hyperlinks, mobile apps are usually isolated building blocks, and the lack of direct links between apps has largely compromised the efficiency of task completion. In this paper, we present an empirical study of inter-app navigation behaviors of smartphone users based on a comprehensive data set collected through a sizable user study over three months. We distinguish informational pages and transitional pages, based on which a large number of inter-app navigation are identified. We demonstrate that developing deep links between internal pages of different apps has a huge potential to reduce the cost of navigation. A machine learning algorithm is able to accurately predict the next page of an app a user is navigating into. Our analysis provides various interesting implications on how to improve app-navigation experiences from both the operation systems' perspective and the developers' perspective."
